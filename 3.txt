Wi-Fi networks have become increasingly popular in multimedia applications, 
which can be attributed to their low cost,
constantly increasing bandwidth and relative ease of deployment.
The IEEE802.11n standard enables multimedia streaming thanks
to its higher bandwidth and is now being deployed in applications
where previously proprietary radio systems were required.
However, in situations where strict QoS guarantees are required,
the standard IEEE802.11 has no answers. Although it can adjust
some of the QoS parameters, it is still not possible to provide any
guarantees. Using the Wi-Fi cards in TDMA access mode would be
able to solve this QoS guarantee issue. Manufacturing such chip that
allows for TDMA access mode is an incredibly expensive undertaking that
 would only be profitable in huge volumes. However, since
the MAC layer is completely embedded in the Linux kernel and a
